# CTEC3905 Assignment

This repository contains my CTEC3905 assignment - the theme is my own work. It has four pages, one being the home screen and the other three being about projects I have worked on. It pulls information from the GitHub repos they are on and has a dark mode which persists between sessions. It's responsive and works on mobile, tablets and desktops.

## Notes

This has been developed for and tested in Google Chrome, but should still work in other major modern browsers.
