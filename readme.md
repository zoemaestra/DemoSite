# CTEC3905 P2423891 Assignment

This repository contains my CTEC3905 assignment - the theme is my own work. It has four pages, one being the home screen and the other three being about projects I have worked on. It pulls information from the GitHub repos they are on and has a dark mode which persists between sessions. It's responsive and works on mobile, tablets and desktops.

## Notes

This has been developed for Google Chrome and tested in Mozilla Firefox. Using it in Firefox has a minor bug where it animates in the dark theme on every page load, this does not exist in Chrome.
